## OCA Chapter 3 Essentials

##### Be able to determine the output of code using *String*
* Concatenate String with numerical values
* Immutable: Don't for get to assign return value of String methods
* Know how many String objects are created (GC!)
* String pool and String equality
* == vs. equals()
* Know exact meaning of index in methods, e.g. substring()

##### Be able to determine the output of code using *StringBuilder*
* Mutable
* Some methods change the object, some not
* No implementation of equals()

#### Be able to determine the output of code using arrays
* Fixed length
* Array initializers
* Note different methods/attributes in arrays, Strings, ...: size(), length(), length
* Don't forget to import Collection objects (java.util)
* Variable length in multidimensional arrays

#### Be able to determine the output of code using *ArrayList*
* Variable length
* Know most important methods
* Convert array <-> ArrayList. Know when there is a *backed* list.
* Only for objects. Note autoboxing for primitives.

#### Autoboxing
* Know methods of wrapper classes: valueOf(), parseXXX()

#### Recognize invalid uses of dates and times
* Note difference to legacy dates (e.g. index for month starting at 1)
* Immutable objects
* Also experienced developers should have a close look on new methods
