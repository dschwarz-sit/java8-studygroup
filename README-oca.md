* Imports resolved at compile time, not at runtime

##### Be able to recognize a constructor
* Initializing (order)
* Initializer blocks

##### Be able to identify legal and illegal declarations and initialization
* Class variables vs. local variables
* Default values
* Legal identifiers (e.g. currency symbols, special characters)
* Literals (float, long, hex, octal, underscore, ...)

##### Be able to determine where variables go into and out of scope
* Where is a variable valid
* Local variables, class and instance variables

##### Know how to identify when an object is eligible for garbage collection
* Know the scope
* Objects vs. references
* Questions: How many objects are eligible
* Draw a graph!

## Chapter 2

##### Be able to write code that uses Java operators
* Be careful about logical/binary operators
* Short circuit with logical/ternary operators

##### Be able to recognize which operators are associated with which data types
* Which operators are allowed on which types (boolean, numeric, ...)
* Numeric promotion
* Assignment

##### Understand Java operator precedence
* Table p52
* Be careful about assignment and equals comparator

##### Be able to write code that uses parenthesis to override operator precedence

##### Understand *if* and *switch* decision control statements
* Supported types for if: boolean
* Supported types for switch: literals, const, enum. No long.
* Be careful about missing breaks
* Look out for wrong indentation

##### Understand loop statements
* For loops: Variable declaration and scope

##### Understand how *break* and *continue* can change flow control
* Affects inner loop
* Optional label
